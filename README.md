**A Quantum-Informational Framework for the Preservation of Consciousness Across Cosmological Aeons**

By Brandon Hans | February 2026 | Independent Research

## What is this?

This paper proposes that biological consciousness may persist across cosmological cycles through quantum information dynamics — and that the world's religious traditions are distorted receptions of this process.

The framework builds on:

- **Roger Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC)** — the idea that the universe goes through infinite cycles (aeons), with the end of one becoming the beginning of the next
- **Quantum information theory** — specifically the no-deletion theorem, which proves that quantum information cannot be destroyed
- **The Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR theory** — which proposes that consciousness arises from quantum computations in the brain's microtubules

## The Core Idea

When the brain dies, the quantum information encoding consciousness doesn't get destroyed — it disperses into the environment through decoherence. Over cosmological timescales, this information spreads across the universe. At the end of the aeon, Penrose's conformal rescaling carries it into the next cosmic cycle as part of the initial conditions of a new Big Bang.

Religious traditions — Christianity's purgatory, Hindu reincarnation, Buddhist samsara, Norse Ragnarok — are all decoding the same underlying signal through different cultural lenses. They're not wrong. They're working with a lossy decoder.

They are **folklore of physics**.

## Honest Disclaimers

This is a philosophical framework, not a proven scientific theory. The open questions are substantial and are discussed honestly in Section 7 of the paper. The value is in framing the question, not in claiming to have solved it.
