## Abstract

This paper proposes a framework for understanding how biological consciousness might persist across cosmological cycles within Sir Roger Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC). Rather than relying on gravitational time dilation at the moment of death—a mechanism that lacks physical justification in flat spacetime—this revised framework draws on quantum information theory, the quantum no-deletion theorem, and the Penrose-Hameroff theory of quantum consciousness to propose a physically grounded mechanism for information transfer between aeons.

The framework further proposes that the structural similarities found across the world's religious traditions—Christianity's purgatory, Hindu reincarnation, Buddhist samsara, Norse Ragnarok—are not coincidental but represent distorted receptions of the same underlying physical phenomenon: the lossy transfer of quantum information across cosmological boundaries. In this view, religious traditions are "folklore of physics"—rational attempts to decode a real signal using the conceptual tools available at the time of their creation.

## 1. The Problem with the Original Proposal

The original version of this theory proposed that biological death triggers an extreme subjective time dilation—analogous to approaching a black hole's event horizon—that stretches the final moment of consciousness toward subjective infinity. This "Subjective Asymptote" would allow the dying subject's information state to persist until the end of the current aeon, at which point it would transfer across the conformal boundary into the next cosmic cycle.

This proposal had an elegant structure: the time dilation served as a "waiting room," the conformal crossover served as a "gate," and the information transfer into the next aeon served as a form of reincarnation. However, it contained a critical flaw: there is no known physical mechanism that would produce relativistic time dilation during ordinary biological death. Time dilation requires extreme spacetime curvature (as near a black hole) or extreme velocity (as near the speed of light). Neither condition is present in the dying human brain. The spacetime at the surface of the Earth is essentially flat, and the brain is stationary relative to its local reference frame.

Without a mechanism for dilation, the framework's most promising feature—a physically grounded alternative to mystical afterlife concepts—collapses. What follows is a revised proposal that replaces gravitational time dilation with quantum information dynamics, providing a mechanism that is both physically grounded and compatible with existing theoretical work.

## 2. Foundations: Quantum Mechanics and Information

### 2.1 Classical vs. Quantum Information

In classical physics, information is stored in definite physical states. A switch is on or off. A neuron has fired or it has not. When the physical substrate is destroyed, the information it carried is destroyed with it. This is the basis of the standard materialist objection to consciousness surviving death: the brain decays, its configurations are lost, and therefore the information that constituted the person is irreversibly gone.

Quantum mechanics fundamentally alters this picture. At the quantum scale, particles do not possess definite states until measured. They exist in superpositions—probability distributions across multiple possible states simultaneously. This is not a limitation of measurement technology; it is a proven feature of physical reality, confirmed by decades of experimental evidence. If consciousness has a quantum component, then the information encoding a person's mental state is not stored as a classical file on a hard drive, but as a quantum state with fundamentally different properties.

### 2.2 Entanglement and Nonlocality

Quantum entanglement occurs when two particles interact and become correlated in such a way that measuring one instantaneously determines the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them. This phenomenon, which Einstein famously dismissed as "spooky action at a distance," has been experimentally confirmed beyond any reasonable doubt.

The relevance to consciousness preservation is that entanglement demonstrates quantum information is not strictly local. Unlike classical information, which is confined to the physical object storing it, quantum information can have nonlocal correlations that persist across arbitrary distances. This means that the information content of a quantum system is not entirely contained within its spatial boundaries.

### 2.3 The No-Deletion Theorem

Perhaps the most critical principle for this framework is the quantum no-deletion theorem, which states that quantum information cannot be destroyed. It can be transformed, scrambled, and rendered practically impossible to retrieve—but it cannot be eliminated from the universe.

This principle was central to the famous Hawking-Susskind debate over black hole information. Stephen Hawking initially argued that black holes destroy information when they evaporate. Leonard Susskind countered that this would violate quantum mechanics. After decades of debate, Hawking conceded: the information is preserved, encoded in the Hawking radiation emitted as the black hole evaporates. If information survives a black hole—the most destructive environment in the known universe—then the death of a biological brain does not represent the destruction of the quantum information it contained. It represents its dispersal.

## 3. The Penrose-Hameroff Bridge

The connection between quantum information theory and biological consciousness is provided by the Penrose-Hameroff theory of Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR). This theory, developed by Sir Roger Penrose and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, proposes that consciousness is not merely the product of classical electrochemical signaling between neurons, but arises from quantum computations occurring within microtubules—protein structures found inside every neuron.

Hameroff's research has provided evidence that microtubules can maintain quantum coherence at biological temperatures, contrary to the widespread assumption that quantum effects would be destroyed by the warm, wet environment of the brain. If Orch OR is correct, consciousness is fundamentally quantum in nature, not classical.

This changes everything about the information dynamics of death. If consciousness is classical information, it is destroyed when the brain decays. If consciousness is quantum information, the no-deletion theorem guarantees its preservation. The information is not destroyed—it is released.

## 4. The Revised Mechanism

The revised framework replaces gravitational time dilation with quantum decoherence as the mechanism for consciousness persistence. The process unfolds in four stages:

### 4.1 Stage One: Decoherence at Death

When the brain dies, the quantum systems maintaining consciousness lose coherence. In quantum mechanics, this process is called decoherence—the quantum state does not vanish but becomes entangled with its surrounding environment. The information that constituted the person's conscious experience disperses outward into the local environment: into the body, the surrounding matter, and eventually into thermal radiation leaving the system.

Crucially, this is not destruction. It is transformation. The information becomes scrambled and practically irretrievable, but the no-deletion theorem guarantees it still exists, encoded in the correlations between the countless particles that have interacted with it.

### 4.2 Stage Two: Cosmic Dispersal

Over geological and then cosmological timescales, the quantum information that was once a human consciousness continues to spread. Through thermodynamic processes, it moves from the local environment into the planet, from the planet into radiation emitted into space, and eventually into the cosmic background. By the late stages of the aeon, this information is part of the universe's radiation bath—incredibly diluted, thoroughly scrambled, but physically present.

### 4.3 Stage Three: The Conformal Crossover

In Penrose's CCC framework, the end of an aeon is characterized by a universe that has expanded to a state of maximum entropy, where all matter has decayed and only massless radiation remains. At this point, a conformal rescaling occurs—the infinitely expanded, empty universe becomes mathematically equivalent to the compressed, hot initial state of a new Big Bang.

This is the critical transition. The radiation filling the end-state of the old aeon becomes the initial conditions of the new aeon. Any information encoded in that radiation—including the dispersed quantum information of every consciousness that ever existed—is carried across the boundary. It is not transferred magically; it is transferred because it is physically part of the radiation that becomes the new universe.

### 4.4 Stage Four: Reconstitution

In the new aeon, the information from previous consciousnesses is baked into the initial conditions of the universe. As structures form—galaxies, stars, planets, and eventually biological systems—the patterns from previous aeons are embedded in the fabric of reality. New conscious beings that arise in the new aeon are not blank slates; they are built on a substrate that contains the scrambled information of every consciousness from every previous cycle.

This is reincarnation without memory. The pattern transfers, but the coherence does not. The individual identity is lost in the scrambling of decoherence and cosmic expansion, but the underlying information persists and influences the formation of new systems.

## 5. The Bekenstein Bound Question

A central question posed in the original proposal was whether this process violates the Bekenstein bound—the theoretical upper limit on the amount of information that can be contained within a finite region of space. The Bekenstein bound applies to classical information stored in a localized system. A human brain, with its finite volume and mass, can only contain a finite amount of classical information.

However, the revised framework sidesteps this constraint in two ways. First, if consciousness is quantum information (as Orch OR proposes), then entanglement allows correlations that are not fully captured by the local Bekenstein bound. The total information content of an entangled system is greater than the sum of its locally stored parts. Second, the mechanism does not require the information to remain localized. At the moment of death, the information begins dispersing into an ever-larger region of space. The Bekenstein bound applies to a finite region, but the information is no longer confined to one. It is spreading across the universe, and by the end of the aeon, it is encoded in a cosmic-scale radiation field with an astronomically higher information capacity than any biological system.

## 6. Folklore of Physics: Religion as Lossy Compression

The most philosophically provocative element of this framework is not the mechanism itself, but its implications for the origins of religious belief. If consciousness information transfers across aeons—even in a highly distorted form—then the possibility exists that traces of this process have been detected by human beings throughout history, and that religious traditions represent attempts to interpret these traces.

Consider the structural parallels across independent traditions:

**Christianity** describes purgatory—a waiting state between death and final judgment—which corresponds to the cosmological interval between death and the conformal crossover. The "gate" of final judgment maps onto the aeon transition itself.

**Hinduism** describes reincarnation—consciousness returning in a new form after death—which corresponds to information reconstitution in the new aeon. The absence of memory across lives is explained by decoherence-induced scrambling during transfer.

**Buddhism** describes samsara—an infinite cycle of existence, death, and rebirth—which is structurally identical to CCC's infinite sequence of aeons.

**Norse mythology** describes Ragnarok—the destruction and rebirth of the cosmos—which mirrors the conformal rescaling between aeons with remarkable precision.

**Ancient Egyptian religion** was built around preserving the body and identity for passage to the next world, reflecting an intuitive grasp of the importance of information preservation for post-death continuity.

These traditions arose independently across cultures separated by thousands of miles and centuries of time. The conventional explanation is that shared human psychology and existential anxiety produce convergent myths. This framework proposes an additional, more provocative explanation: the convergence reflects the detection of a real physical signal, decoded through the conceptual tools available to each civilization.

In this view, religious traditions are cargo cults of physics. During World War II, indigenous Pacific Islanders observed American military aircraft delivering supplies. After the war, some communities built wooden replicas of airplanes and control towers, performing rituals to summon the planes back. They had observed a real phenomenon but lacked the context to understand its mechanism, so they reconstructed it through their existing framework. The planes became gods. The runways became temples.

This framework suggests that every religion on Earth has done something similar: observed traces of a real physical process—the transfer of information across cosmic cycles—and built a mythological structure to explain it. The signal is real. The decoding is distorted. The religions are not wrong; they are working with a lossy decoder.

This is what gives the framework its name: the world's religious traditions are folklore of physics.

## 7. Open Questions and Honest Limitations

This framework is a philosophical synthesis, not a proven scientific theory. Several critical questions remain unresolved:

**The coherence problem:** Can microtubules truly maintain quantum coherence long enough for Orch OR to function? While Hameroff has presented evidence, this remains disputed within the physics community.

**The fidelity problem:** Even if quantum information survives, the degree of scrambling through decoherence and cosmic expansion may be so extreme that no meaningful pattern persists. The information may technically exist but be so thoroughly randomized that it carries no functional content.

**The detection problem:** If previous-aeon information is encoded in the initial conditions of the new universe, by what mechanism would biological organisms detect or be influenced by it? The framework does not yet specify how scrambled quantum information in the cosmic background translates into the subjective religious experiences reported across cultures.

**The falsifiability problem:** As currently formulated, the framework is difficult to test empirically. This places it in the domain of philosophy rather than hard science, which limits its persuasive power within the physics community.

These limitations are acknowledged openly. The value of this framework lies not in claiming to have solved the problem of consciousness and death, but in proposing a structured, physically motivated alternative to both pure materialism and pure mysticism—one that treats the world's religious traditions as data worthy of explanation rather than errors worthy of dismissal.

## 8. Conclusion

This paper has proposed that biological consciousness may persist across cosmological aeons through a four-stage process: quantum decoherence at death disperses consciousness information into the environment; thermodynamic processes spread this information across the cosmos over billions of years; Penrose's conformal rescaling carries it across the aeon boundary as part of the universe's radiation content; and the information becomes embedded in the initial conditions of the next aeon, potentially influencing the formation of new conscious systems.

The framework draws on established principles of quantum information theory (the no-deletion theorem, decoherence, entanglement), speculative but serious theories of quantum consciousness (Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR), and Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology. It resolves the mechanism gap in the original proposal by replacing gravitational time dilation with quantum information dynamics, and it addresses the Bekenstein bound objection by noting that dispersed quantum information is not subject to the storage limits of a localized biological system.

Most importantly, it reframes the world's religious and mythological traditions not as primitive errors or psychological projections, but as rational—if distorted—receptions of a real physical process. They are folklore of physics: cargo cults built around a signal that is real but was received without the decoder ring of modern science.

The theory is incomplete. The mechanism needs further development. The open questions are substantial. But the pattern across religious traditions is real, the quantum information principles are established, and the questions being asked are the right ones. Sometimes the most important step is not solving the problem, but framing it correctly.
